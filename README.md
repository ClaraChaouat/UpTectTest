## Side notes for the reviewer::technologist:

Fisrt of all, thank you for taking time to review this work.
Then, I'd like to share some details with you to explain some of my choices that I made for this work.

First, you'll notice than I didnt use any JS css library. Why? Because I didn't have the occasion to learn/use any of them (yet).
Next, in the table with color boxes, at the very end of the layout, you'll notice that for the green and the purple boxes, I inserted the entire image (image + text).
Whereas for the others, I built the color boxes by adding the image and the corresponding text. The reason why I built it this way (purple & green boxes) is that I was not able to export the "image part" of it.


I hope you'll like like.

Cheers.
